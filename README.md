# Jenkins Job and pipeline project examples

This is a continuation of [Sheehan's Job DSL gradle example](https://github.com/sheehan/job-dsl-gradle-example) project, which enables you to test your Jenkins Job DSL using a gradle project.

## Roadmap

The plan is to extend this work with also Jenkins pipeline examples, as well as make it possible to use an custom structure.

Further we will explain how to nicely bind this setup with [JenkinsAsCode](https://github.com/Praqma/JenkinsAsCodeReference) using genesis and seedjobs.

# Credits
